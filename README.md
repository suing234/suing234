I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/) & [UniversitÃ© Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/). I have started my Ph.D. work involved in the Innovative Training Networks (ITN) Doctoral Networks - [BEMAGIC](https://bemagic-etn.eu/) which is funded from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the [Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/doctoral-networks). My resaerch lies at using heterostructured multiferroic materials, electric surface charging and magneto-ionics to develop new concepts for magnetic data storage, spintronic devices and magnonics, always with the aim of improving energy efficiency with respect to currently available technologies - with a special focus on the boosting magneto-ionic effect using ion irradiation & ion implantation. If you have any questions on my projects, please feel free to [send me an email](mailto:kammichan90@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]).
